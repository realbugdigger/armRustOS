# ARM64 Rust OS

The reason for making this project was to expand my knowledge on OS internals, virtual memory and memory allocators as well as diving into ARM64 architecture.
There were many online resources that were used for knowledge gaining and inspiration but honorable mention goes to [rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials])
